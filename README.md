# Credit-Bankruptcy

Credit Bankruptcy project aims to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. 
This is a binary classification problem, where the goal is to classify borrowers as either "will default" or "will not default." 
The model will be trained on a dataset of borrowers, which includes features such as credit score, income, loan amount, employment history, etc. 
The performance of the model will be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
In addition to the predictive model, an excel sheet has been created to calculate the profits that the bank can make by using these models. 
The end goal of the project is to develop an accurate and reliable model for predicting loan defaults, which can help the bank make informed decisions about loan approval and manage risk more effectively. 
The excel sheet can provide additional insights into the financial benefits of using the model.
Models developed in this projects are Logistic Model, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor.
